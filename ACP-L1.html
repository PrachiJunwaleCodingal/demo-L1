    <h1> Giant Panda</h1><br>


    The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to
    China. <br> It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its
    body is
    rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3
    in)
    long.<br> It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on
    its
    forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to
    meet its dietary requirements.<br> It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost
    entirely of
    bamboo and bamboo shoots.
